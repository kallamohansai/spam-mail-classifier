# Spam Mail Classifier

This project is a machine learning-based spam mail classifier that identifies spam emails with high accuracy. The project is developed using a Jupyter notebook on Google Colab.

## Introduction

The spam mail classifier project aims to build a model that can accurately classify emails as spam or not spam. This can help in reducing unwanted emails and improving email filtering systems.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature extraction using techniques like TF-IDF
- Model training using machine learning algorithms
- Evaluation metrics to measure the performance of the classifier
- Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
   cd your-repository-name
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/spam_mail_classifier.ipynb
   ```

Alternatively, you can view and run the notebook directly on Google Colab.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook (`notebooks/spam_mail_classifier.ipynb`) in Jupyter or Google Colab.
2. Run all the cells to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate the results.
3. Modify the notebook to test different models or datasets.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of labeled emails, with labels indicating whether an email is spam or not. The dataset can be found in the `email/` directory. If you're using a different dataset, ensure it is in the correct format and update the data loading section in the notebook accordingly.

## Model

The project uses various machine learning algorithms to classify emails. The primary model used in this project is a Naive Bayes classifier, which is well-suited for text classification tasks. The model is trained on the provided dataset and achieves high accuracy in identifying spam emails.

## Results

The performance of the classifier is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The Naive Bayes classifier used in this project achieves an accuracy of **98%**, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying spam emails.
